# LESSON 3: PARTICLE FILTERS
### - Continuous state space with multi-modal distributions
### - Easier to program and most versatile than Kalman Filters 
#### -- Histograms / Localization has exponential computation complexity/efficiency with state space size
#### -- Kalman Filters have quadratic complexity with state space size and are approximate (requires linear systems)
#### -- Particle Filters have unknown complexity with only approximate estimations

### PARTICLES: many particles represent various locations in space
