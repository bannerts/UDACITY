# Lesson 2 - Kalman Filters

## Tracking Intro: Used to estimate the state of a system
### Kalman Filter: Continuous & uni-modal
#### - kalman filter takes observations with noise and uncertainty and estimates automatically state
#### - Measurement update is product related / Bayes rule
#### - Motion update is convolution related / total probability
##### -- Feedback loop combining Measurement cycle and prediction cycle with gausian distributions
##### -- The new belief will be more certain than either the previous belief OR the measurement: more measurements means greater certainty

####
### Monte Carlo Localization: Discrete & multi-modal

####
### Particle Filter: Continuous & multi-modal
