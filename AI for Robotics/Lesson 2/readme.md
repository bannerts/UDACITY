# Lesson 2 - Kalman Filters

## Tracking Intro: Used to estimate the state of a system
### Kalman Filter: Continuous & uni-modal
#### - kalman filter takes observations with noise and uncertainty and estimates automatically state

####
### Monte Carlo Localization: Discrete & multi-modal

####
### Particle Filter: Continuous & multi-modal
