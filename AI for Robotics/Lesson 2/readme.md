# Lesson 2 - Kalman Filters

## Tracking Intro: Used to estimate the state of a system
### Kalman Filter: Continuous with uni-modal distributions (e.g. gausian distribution or similar)
##### - kalman filter takes observations with noise and uncertainty and estimates automatically state
#### Gausian Distributions 
##### - Gaussian distributions are uni-modal
##### - mean
##### - variance

####
### Monte Carlo Localization: Discrete with multi-modal distributions

####
### Particle Filter: Continuous with multi-modal distributions
