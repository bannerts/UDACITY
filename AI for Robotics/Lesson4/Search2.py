# -----------
# User Instructions:
#
# Modify the the search function so that it returns
# a shortest path as follows:
# 
# [['>', 'v', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
#  [' ', '>', '>', '>', '>', 'v'],
#  [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'v'],
#  [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'v'],
#  [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', '*']]
#
# Where '>', '<', '^', and 'v' refer to right, left, 
# up, and down motions. Note that the 'v' should be 
# lowercase. '*' should mark the goal cell.
#
# You may assume that all test cases for this function
# will have a path from init to goal.
